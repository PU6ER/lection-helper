# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the extension icons:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can create simple icons or use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG images.

A simple way to create icons:

1. Create a 128x128 pixel image with a graduation cap emoji ðŸŽ“ or a simple design
2. Resize it to create the smaller versions
3. Save them as PNG files with the exact names above

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
